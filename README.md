# DNN-Invariant-To-Time-Scaling

Academic project where Deep Neural Network which is invariant to Time Scaling has been explored.

Here, I have implemented the SITHCON Network mentioned in this paper. [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.04616)

More details can be found in the project report.

# Experiments

1. Morse Adding Problem
2. Morse Decoding Problem
3. My own experiment on Audio Dataset (Arabic Numbers Dataset)
